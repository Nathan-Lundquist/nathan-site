The most common reason small businesses delay building a real security program: "We don't know what it costs, and we're afraid to find out."

That's fixable. Here are honest market ranges for the most common cybersecurity investments, based on what organizations of 10–200 employees actually pay.

## Why This Is Hard to Find

Security vendors rarely publish prices because:
1. Scope varies dramatically by environment complexity
2. They want to have a conversation before quoting
3. Prices vary by region, company size, and negotiation

This post gives you ranges to work with so you can budget and compare proposals intelligently.

## Security Assessment and Consulting

**Risk Assessment (foundational):** $3,000–$10,000
The starting point for any real security program. Covers asset inventory, threat analysis, vulnerability identification, and a prioritized remediation roadmap. For companies under 50 employees, most engagements land in the $4,000–$7,000 range.

**Penetration Test (external):** $5,000–$20,000
A simulated attack against your externally facing systems. Scope drives price — a basic web app pentest can be $5,000–$8,000; a comprehensive network and application test for a mid-market company runs $12,000–$20,000.

**Penetration Test (internal):** $8,000–$25,000
Tests what an attacker could do after gaining a foothold inside your network. More labor-intensive than external testing.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** $1,500–$6,000
Automated scanning plus professional analysis. Less comprehensive than a penetration test but identifies known vulnerabilities efficiently. Often done quarterly.

## Compliance Readiness

**SOC 2 Readiness (preparation for audit):** $8,000–$30,000
Depends heavily on your starting point. A company with documented policies and mature controls might spend $8,000–$12,000 on readiness. A company starting from scratch might spend $20,000–$30,000 before the audit even begins.

**SOC 2 Audit (CPA firm fees):**
- Type 1: $8,000–$25,000
- Type 2: $15,000–$40,000

**ISO 27001 Readiness + Certification:** $25,000–$75,000 total
Includes gap assessment, ISMS documentation, internal audit, and certification body fees.

**HIPAA Compliance Assessment:** $3,000–$10,000
Risk analysis plus gap assessment against HIPAA Security Rule requirements. Most SMB healthcare organizations land in the $4,000–$7,000 range.

**Compliance Platform (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe):** $10,000–$20,000/year
These platforms automate evidence collection, monitor controls continuously, and significantly reduce audit preparation time. Strong ROI for companies pursuing SOC 2 or ISO 27001.

## Managed Security Services

**MSSP (full managed security for an SMB):** $3,000–$10,000/month
Wide range based on scope. Basic coverage (MDR + firewall management) for a 50-person company might be $4,000–$6,000/month. Comprehensive coverage including compliance management, awareness training, and 24/7 SOC runs higher.

**Managed Detection and Response (MDR):** $15–$40/endpoint/month
Security monitoring and threat response for your devices. A 50-endpoint environment might cost $750–$2,000/month for MDR alone.

**Virtual CISO (vCISO):** $3,000–$10,000/month
A fractional security executive who oversees your security program, attends executive meetings, guides vendor selection, and drives compliance initiatives. Typically 10–20 hours/month. For companies not ready to hire a full-time CISO ($200,000–$300,000+/year), this is the practical alternative.

## Point Security Tools

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** $5–$25/endpoint/month
CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. A 50-device environment: $250–$1,250/month.

**Email Security (advanced filtering + anti-phishing):** $3–$8/user/month
Proofpoint, Mimecast, Microsoft Defender for Office 365. 50 users: $150–$400/month.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** $3–$9/user/month
Duo Security, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID. 50 users: $150–$450/month. Many organizations already have MFA capabilities bundled in their Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace plan.

**Security Awareness Training + Phishing Simulation:** $1–$5/user/month
KnowBe4, Proofpoint SAT, Cofense. 50 users: $50–$250/month.

**Password Manager (business):** $4–$8/user/month
1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane. Addresses credential reuse, which is a leading cause of account compromise.

## The Biggest Mistake: Buying Tools Without a Strategy

Buying $30,000 worth of security tools without understanding your actual risk profile is common and expensive. Organizations often have:
- Three overlapping endpoint protection tools
- Security training that no one completes
- Expensive compliance platforms for frameworks they don't actually need
- No idea whether any of it is working

A risk assessment at the start costs $5,000–$8,000 and tells you exactly where to spend the rest.

## A Practical Budget Framework

**Minimum viable security for a 25-person SMB:** ~$2,000–$4,000/month
- EDR: $500/month
- Email security: $150/month
- MFA: $150/month
- Security awareness training: $100/month
- Managed detection and response: $1,000–$2,500/month

**Growing company with compliance needs (50 people, pursuing SOC 2):** ~$8,000–$15,000/month
- Above tools + compliance platform
- vCISO engagement
- Annual penetration test (amortized)
- SOC 2 readiness and audit (amortized)

## What a Breach Actually Costs

The numbers above feel significant until you compare them to breach costs:

- **Average cost of a data breach (all company sizes):** $4.88 million (IBM 2024)
- **Median ransomware payment:** $812,000 (Sophos 2024)
- **Average downtime from a ransomware attack:** 22 days
- **Cyber insurance premium increase post-breach:** 50–200%

Security spending is not a cost center. It's insurance with the added benefit of making your systems better.
