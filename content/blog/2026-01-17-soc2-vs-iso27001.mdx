You're building out your security program. Enterprise prospects are asking about your compliance posture. Someone in sales mentioned "SOC 2" and someone in legal mentioned "ISO 27001" and now you need to decide.

Here's the honest comparison.

## The Fundamental Difference

**SOC 2** is an auditing standard created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It produces an audit *report* — not a certification — that a CPA firm issues after evaluating your controls. It's based on the Trust Services Criteria and is primarily recognized in the United States and Canada.

**ISO 27001** is an international standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It produces a *certification* — issued by an accredited certification body — and is recognized globally, particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.

The distinction matters: SOC 2 gives you a report you share confidentially with customers. ISO 27001 gives you a certification you can publicly announce and display.

## Geographic Relevance

**If your customers are primarily in the US:** SOC 2 is almost universally what they'll ask for. US enterprise procurement teams, investors, and cyber insurers are very familiar with SOC 2. ISO 27001 may satisfy some questionnaires but is not the norm.

**If your customers are in Europe or internationally:** ISO 27001 is often required or strongly preferred. Many EU procurement processes, government contracts, and regulated industries specifically require ISO 27001 certification.

**If you're expanding globally:** You may eventually need both. The frameworks overlap significantly enough that organizations pursuing both typically do them in sequence, using ISO 27001 as the foundation and layering SOC 2 on top.

## What They Actually Evaluate

**SOC 2** evaluates five Trust Services Criteria:
- **Security** (required; everyone starts here)
- Availability
- Processing Integrity
- Confidentiality
- Privacy

The auditor determines whether your controls are suitably designed (Type 1) and operating effectively over time (Type 2). The output is a report that describes your controls and the auditor's findings.

**ISO 27001** requires you to build and certify an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** — a comprehensive, documented management system covering 93 controls across 11 domains (Annex A). The certification body evaluates whether your ISMS conforms to the standard and is effectively implemented.

The key conceptual difference: SOC 2 asks "do these specific controls work?" ISO 27001 asks "do you have a comprehensive, systematic approach to managing information security?"

## Cost Comparison

**SOC 2 costs (US company, 10–50 employees):**
- Readiness preparation: $5,000–$20,000
- Compliance platform (Vanta, Drata, etc.): $10,000–$15,000/year
- CPA audit firm fees — Type 1: $8,000–$20,000; Type 2: $15,000–$35,000
- **Total first year: $25,000–$65,000**

**ISO 27001 costs (same company profile):**
- Gap assessment and implementation consulting: $15,000–$40,000
- Documentation development: $5,000–$15,000
- Internal audit preparation: $3,000–$8,000
- Certification body audit: $10,000–$25,000
- **Total first year: $30,000–$80,000**

ISO 27001 tends to cost somewhat more, primarily because the ISMS documentation requirements are more extensive and the audit scope is broader.

## Timeline Comparison

**SOC 2 Type 1:** 3–5 months from start to report
**SOC 2 Type 2:** 9–18 months from start to first report (requires 6–12 month observation period)
**ISO 27001:** 6–12 months to certification for most organizations

For time-sensitive sales needs, SOC 2 Type 1 is often pursued first because it's faster.

## Who Usually Chooses Each

**Organizations that typically pursue SOC 2:**
- B2B SaaS companies with US enterprise customers
- Cloud service providers
- Fintech companies
- Healthcare technology companies
- Any company where a specific large customer is asking for it

**Organizations that typically pursue ISO 27001:**
- Companies with European customers or operations
- Organizations bidding on government contracts internationally
- Companies whose customers have an international procurement standard
- Organizations that want a rigorous, comprehensive management system

## The Framework Overlap Is Significant

Both frameworks ultimately require you to build similar foundational security capabilities:
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Access management
- Vulnerability management
- Incident response
- Business continuity
- Vendor management
- Security awareness training

The documentation and audit format differ, but the security controls that satisfy one framework heavily overlap with what the other requires. Organizations that achieve one are typically 50–70% of the way to the other.

## What to Do If Customers Are Asking for Both

This is increasingly common. The practical answer:

1. **Start with SOC 2 Type 2** if your primary market is the US. The compliance infrastructure you build (policies, procedures, evidence collection) gives you most of what ISO 27001 needs.
2. **Layer ISO 27001 on top** once SOC 2 is achieved, mapping your existing controls to the Annex A requirements and filling gaps.
3. **Consider using Annex A as your control framework from the start** — building your initial program against ISO 27001's 93 controls ensures you're not building technical debt if ISO certification is a future goal.
