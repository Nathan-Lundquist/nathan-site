If you sell software to enterprises, or if your company handles customer data in any meaningful way, you've probably been asked for a SOC 2 report. Or you're about to be.

SOC 2 is not a government regulation. It's an auditing standard created by the AICPA (the accounting body) that has become the de facto trust credential for technology companies in the US. When a prospect's security questionnaire asks "do you have SOC 2?" — this is what they mean.

Here's what you actually need to know.

## What SOC 2 Actually Evaluates

SOC 2 is organized around five **Trust Services Criteria**:

1. **Security** — Your systems are protected against unauthorized access (required for all SOC 2 reports)
2. **Availability** — Systems are available for operation as committed
3. **Processing Integrity** — System processing is complete, accurate, and authorized
4. **Confidentiality** — Information designated as confidential is protected
5. **Privacy** — Personal information is collected, used, and disclosed appropriately

Most companies start with Security only, then add Availability and Confidentiality as customer demand grows.

## Type 1 vs Type 2: The Difference That Matters

**SOC 2 Type 1** is a point-in-time report. An auditor evaluates whether your security controls *exist* and are *designed appropriately* as of a specific date. Think of it as "here's a photo of our controls right now."

**SOC 2 Type 2** is a period-of-time report, typically covering 6 or 12 months. The auditor evaluates whether your controls were *operating effectively* throughout that entire period. This is what enterprise customers actually want — it's substantially more rigorous.

The common path: Get Type 1 to satisfy near-term sales pipeline needs, then pursue Type 2 to build long-term credibility.

## What Controls Does SOC 2 Require?

SOC 2 doesn't prescribe specific controls — it evaluates whether your controls achieve the Trust Services Criteria. That said, you'll need to demonstrate mature practices in:

- **Access Management** — Least-privilege access, offboarding procedures, MFA enforcement
- **Change Management** — Code review processes, deployment controls, testing procedures
- **Risk Management** — Documented risk assessment process and treatment decisions
- **Incident Response** — Documented plan, testing, and evidence of response to past incidents
- **Vendor Management** — Review of third-party risks for services that handle your data
- **Monitoring and Alerting** — Evidence that you detect and respond to anomalies
- **Encryption** — Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Business Continuity** — Backup procedures, recovery testing, documented RTO/RPO

The most common audit failures aren't technical — they're documentation failures. Controls that work but aren't documented don't exist in an auditor's eyes.

## Realistic Timeline

**Type 1:**
- Readiness Assessment: 2–4 weeks
- Remediation (filling gaps): 4–12 weeks (depends on maturity)
- Audit itself: 2–4 weeks
- **Total: 3–5 months from start to report**

**Type 2:**
- After completing Type 1 (or parallel): 6–12 month observation period
- Audit: 4–8 weeks
- **Total: 9–18 months from decision to first Type 2 report**

First-time Type 2 audits almost always cover 6 months, not 12. Subsequent renewals are typically annual.

## Honest Cost Breakdown

**Preparation (readiness assessment + gap remediation):**
- DIY with consultant guidance: $5,000–$15,000
- Full-service consultant/firm: $15,000–$50,000

**Audit fees (paid to the CPA firm conducting the audit):**
- Type 1: $8,000–$25,000
- Type 2: $15,000–$40,000+

**Compliance platform (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, etc.):**
- $10,000–$20,000/year (these automate evidence collection and make audits significantly cheaper)

**Total first-year investment for a company of 10–50 people:**
- Lean path (compliance platform + boutique auditor): $30,000–$50,000
- Full-service path: $60,000–$100,000

These numbers feel large. Consider that losing a $500K enterprise deal because you can't produce a SOC 2 report makes the math obvious.

## The Five Most Common Readiness Failures

1. **No documented access review process** — You need evidence of quarterly access reviews, not just good intentions
2. **No formal vendor risk assessment** — Any SaaS tool you use that touches customer data needs to be evaluated
3. **Missing incident response plan** — Must be documented and tested, not just "we'd figure it out"
4. **Logging and monitoring gaps** — Auditors want evidence of anomaly detection, not just logs that exist
5. **Weak offboarding controls** — Former employee accounts that linger are red flags

## Do You Need SOC 2?

You need SOC 2 if:
- **Your enterprise prospects require it** — If deals are stalling in procurement because of a missing SOC 2, you need it
- **You handle customer data** — Especially PII, financial data, or health information
- **You're building a security-conscious brand** — Being able to say "yes, we're SOC 2 Type 2 compliant" is a sales asset

You may not need SOC 2 yet if:
- You're pre-revenue or very early stage with no enterprise pipeline
- Your customers are primarily consumers, not businesses
