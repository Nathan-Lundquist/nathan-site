Your MSP has been great. They keep your laptops running, manage your Microsoft 365 licenses, and show up when the printer won't connect. You trust them.

But when ransomware encrypted your file server last March, they had to call someone else.

MSPs and MSSPs serve fundamentally different purposes. Conflating them is one of the most expensive mistakes a growing business can make.

## What an MSP Does

A **Managed Service Provider (MSP)** manages your IT infrastructure. Their job is availability and functionality:

- Managing endpoints (laptops, desktops, servers)
- Network monitoring and maintenance
- Help desk support
- Software licensing management
- Backup configuration (usually)
- Patching and updates

An MSP's success metric is **uptime**. Are your systems running? Are tickets getting resolved? Is everyone able to do their job?

MSPs are not security-first organizations. Most have some security-adjacent offerings (endpoint protection, email filtering) but their core competency is operations, not threat detection and response.

## What an MSSP Does

A **Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)** is purpose-built to detect, respond to, and prevent cyberattacks. Their job is protection:

- 24/7 security monitoring (SIEM/SOC operations)
- Threat detection and incident response
- Vulnerability management and patching prioritization
- Firewall and network security management
- Identity and access management
- Compliance support (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)
- Security awareness training
- Penetration testing coordination

An MSSP's success metric is **risk reduction**. Are we detecting threats before they become incidents? Are we closing vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them? Do we have evidence of our controls for compliance purposes?

## The Dangerous Middle Ground

Many MSPs have added "security" offerings to their product catalog — endpoint detection software, email security, maybe a quarterly vulnerability scan. This creates a dangerous perception: *we're being protected by our MSP.*

What most MSP security packages lack:
- **24/7 monitoring** — Attacks don't happen during business hours
- **Threat hunting** — Proactively looking for attackers who are already inside
- **Security expertise** — MSP technicians are generalists; security requires specialists
- **Compliance documentation** — Evidence for auditors requires structured processes MSPs typically don't have

The risk isn't that MSPs are dishonest. It's that most businesses don't know to ask the right questions.

## Five Questions to Ask Your Current MSP

1. *"If ransomware hit us at 3 a.m. on a Saturday, who responds? How fast?"*
2. *"Do you provide a monthly report showing detected threats and remediated vulnerabilities?"*
3. *"Do you have a dedicated security operations team, or does the same person managing help desk tickets handle security alerts?"*
4. *"Can you provide documentation of our security controls that an auditor would accept?"*
5. *"Are you carrying cyber liability insurance, and what is your contractual liability if a breach occurs on your watch?"*

The answers will tell you a lot.

## When an MSP Is Enough

If your organization:
- Has fewer than 10 employees
- Handles no sensitive customer data
- Faces no compliance requirements
- Has a limited budget

...a good MSP with solid security hygiene (MFA enforcement, quality endpoint protection, backup testing) may be sufficient for now. Build the foundation.

## When You Need an MSSP

You need dedicated managed security services if:
- **You face compliance obligations** — SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001 require controls that MSPs typically can't document properly
- **You have enterprise customers** — They will ask about your security program in vendor due diligence
- **You handle sensitive data** — PHI, financial records, PII — the value of what you're holding changes your risk profile
- **You operate in a high-threat industry** — Healthcare, finance, legal, and technology companies are disproportionately targeted
- **You've had an incident** — A breach changes everything

## The Co-Managed Model

Many businesses find the best answer is a **co-managed model**: keep your MSP handling day-to-day IT operations, and layer an MSSP (or a security consultant) on top for security-specific functions. The two teams coordinate, each doing what they're best at.

This is often cheaper than full MSSP replacement and avoids the disruption of switching your entire IT vendor.

The question isn't "MSP or MSSP?" — it's "what level of security do we actually need, and do our current vendors deliver it?" Those are two different questions, and the second one is harder to answer.
