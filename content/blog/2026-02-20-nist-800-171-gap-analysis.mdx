A gap analysis is the first — and most important — step toward CMMC Level 2 compliance. Done right, it tells you exactly where you stand against all 110 NIST 800-171 Rev 2 requirements before anyone else evaluates you.

## What Is a Gap Analysis?

A gap analysis compares your current security posture against the requirements of NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2. For each of the 110 security requirements, you're assessing:

- **Met** — Fully implemented and documented
- **Partially Met** — Implemented but not documented, or partially implemented
- **Not Met** — Not implemented

## Step 1: Define Your CUI Scope

Before you evaluate anything, you need to know where your CUI lives. This means mapping:

- All systems that store, process, or transmit CUI
- Network segments that touch CUI systems
- People who have access to CUI
- Third parties (contractors, cloud providers) who handle CUI

If you haven't built a System Security Plan (SSP) yet, your scope definition becomes the foundation.

## Step 2: Evaluate Each Practice

Work through each of the 14 families and 110 practices systematically. For each one, ask:

1. Have we implemented this control?
2. Do we have documentation proving it?
3. Is the documentation accurate and current?

Don't inflate your scores. Assessors will verify — and discrepancies between your self-assessment and actual implementation are a red flag.

## Step 3: Score and Prioritize

NIST 800-171 has a scoring methodology — some requirements carry more weight than others. Prioritize your remediation by:

- Requirements with the highest impact on your score
- Requirements that are foundational to others (access control, for example)
- Quick wins that can be addressed rapidly

## Step 4: Build Your POAM

Every gap becomes an item in your Plan of Action & Milestones (POAM). Each item should include:

- The specific requirement not met
- The weakness or deficiency
- The planned remediation action
- Responsible party and target completion date
- Resources required

A well-built POAM isn't just a compliance artifact — it's your roadmap to certification.
