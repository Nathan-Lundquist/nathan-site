CMMC Level 2 aligns directly with NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 and covers **110 security practices** across 14 domains. If your organization handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) under a DoD contract, you almost certainly need to achieve and maintain CMMC Level 2 compliance.

## What Is CMMC Level 2?

CMMC Level 2 is the second tier of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification framework. It's designed for companies in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) that process, store, or transmit CUI — information that requires safeguarding but isn't classified.

The 14 domains covered include:

- Access Control
- Audit and Accountability
- Configuration Management
- Identification and Authentication
- Incident Response
- Maintenance
- Media Protection
- Personnel Security
- Physical Protection
- Risk Assessment
- Security Assessment
- System and Communications Protection
- System and Information Integrity
- Awareness and Training

## The Assessment Process

Unlike Level 1 (self-attestation), CMMC Level 2 for most contractors requires a **third-party assessment** by a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO). Here's what to expect:

1. **Pre-Assessment Preparation** — Gap analysis, SSP development, POAM creation
2. **Evidence Collection** — Documenting implementation of all 110 practices
3. **C3PAO Assessment** — On-site or remote evaluation by certified assessors
4. **Remediation (if needed)** — Addressing any deficiencies found
5. **Certification** — Issued by the Cyber AB upon successful completion

## How to Prepare

The most common failure point isn't technical controls — it's **documentation**. Your System Security Plan (SSP) must accurately describe how each practice is implemented in your specific environment.

Start with a gap analysis to understand your current posture, then build a Plan of Action & Milestones (POAM) to address gaps systematically.
