Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is the linchpin of CMMC compliance. Yet many defense contractors struggle to accurately identify what qualifies as CUI in their environment — and that misidentification can sink an entire compliance program.

## What Qualifies as CUI?

CUI is defined by the National Archives' CUI Registry. It covers dozens of categories, but for most DIB contractors, the most common types include:

- **CTI** — Controlled Technical Information (specs, drawings, engineering data)
- **Export Controlled** — ITAR/EAR-regulated technical data
- **Privacy** — Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in certain contexts
- **Procurement and Acquisition** — Source selection information, bid data

The key question: *Does your contract include a DFARS 252.204-7012 clause?* If so, you're handling CUI.

## Common CUI Identification Mistakes

**1. Scope creep in reverse** — Assuming only obvious documents (contracts, specs) contain CUI while missing CUI embedded in emails, meeting notes, and collaboration tools.

**2. Ignoring metadata** — File names, email headers, and document properties can contain CUI.

**3. Cloud blind spots** — CUI stored in personal OneDrive, Google Drive, or unapproved cloud services is still your responsibility.

**4. Third-party flow-down** — When you subcontract work, CUI flows with it. Your subs need to be compliant too.

## Building Your CUI Inventory

A proper CUI inventory maps:
- What CUI you hold (types and categories)
- Where it lives (systems, locations, media)
- Who has access
- How it flows through your environment

This inventory becomes the foundation of your System Security Plan and your CMMC assessment scope.
