HIPAA has been the law since 1996, but the security requirements have changed significantly. The 2025 update to the HIPAA Security Rule — the most significant revision in over a decade — introduced concrete new requirements that many healthcare organizations are still not aware of.

If your organization handles protected health information (PHI) in any form, here's what you need to know.

## Who Needs to Be HIPAA Compliant?

More organizations than most people realize.

**Covered Entities** are required to comply:
- Healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, physicians, dentists, pharmacies, therapists)
- Health plans and health insurers
- Healthcare clearinghouses

**Business Associates** — any third party that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a covered entity — are equally bound:
- Cloud storage providers used by healthcare organizations
- Billing services, coding services
- Legal firms handling healthcare matters
- IT managed service providers with access to healthcare systems
- Marketing firms using patient data
- Software vendors whose products access PHI

If you're a SaaS company and healthcare organizations are your customers, you are almost certainly a business associate and need a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with each covered entity customer.

## What Is PHI?

Protected Health Information is individually identifiable health information. It includes:
- Names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses — *when linked to health information*
- Medical record numbers, account numbers, device identifiers
- Diagnostic information, treatment records, prescription history
- Any photographs or other identifiers that could identify the individual

The "linked to health information" element is important. A patient's name in your CRM is not PHI. A patient's name and their diagnosis in your EHR is.

## The 2025 Security Rule Updates: What Changed

The HHS published a final rule in 2025 that substantially strengthened the HIPAA Security Rule. Key additions:

### Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
MFA is now required for all access to systems containing ePHI (electronic PHI). Previously, MFA was an "addressable" specification — meaning organizations could document why they didn't implement it. The 2025 update makes it a required implementation specification with no exception. All users, including administrators.

### ePHI Inventory and Data Flow Mapping
Organizations must now maintain a documented inventory of all ePHI — what systems contain it, where it flows, who has access. This was previously implicit; it's now an explicit requirement with documentation expected.

### Patch Management Requirements
Specific timeframes for patching vulnerabilities in systems that contain or access ePHI:
- Critical vulnerabilities: 15 days
- High vulnerabilities: 30 days
- All other vulnerabilities: addressed within a documented risk-based timeframe

### Business Associate Oversight
Stronger requirements for monitoring business associates, including:
- Annual review of business associate compliance
- Documentation of assessments
- Right to audit language in BAAs

### Incident Response Testing
Organizations must test their incident response and contingency plans annually and document the results.

## The HIPAA Security Rule Framework

The Security Rule is organized into three categories of safeguards:

### Administrative Safeguards
The policies, procedures, and training requirements:
- Risk Analysis (must be conducted and documented)
- Risk Management (a plan to address identified risks)
- Workforce Training (all employees with ePHI access must be trained)
- Access Control policies (who can access what, and why)
- Incident Response procedures

### Physical Safeguards
Controls over physical access to systems containing ePHI:
- Facility access controls
- Workstation security (screen locks, physical placement)
- Device and media controls (tracking devices, secure disposal)

### Technical Safeguards
The technology controls protecting ePHI:
- Access control systems (unique user IDs, automatic logoff)
- Audit controls (logs of who accessed what, when)
- Integrity controls (detecting unauthorized modification of ePHI)
- Transmission security (encryption of ePHI in transit)

## Most Common HIPAA Compliance Failures

Based on HHS enforcement history, the most common violations are:

1. **No risk analysis** — Organizations that have never conducted a formal risk assessment are immediately non-compliant; this is the most cited violation
2. **Lack of MFA** — Especially on email and remote access; massively accelerated in enforcement post-2025 update
3. **Missing or outdated BAAs** — Vendors with ePHI access operating without signed agreements
4. **Inadequate workforce training** — Training records that don't cover all employees, or annual training that hasn't happened
5. **Impermissible disclosures** — Sharing PHI without authorization or with unauthorized parties

## HIPAA Penalties in 2025

Fines are structured in four tiers based on culpability:

- **Tier 1 (No knowledge):** $141–$71,162 per violation
- **Tier 2 (Reasonable cause):** $1,424–$71,162 per violation
- **Tier 3 (Willful neglect, corrected):** $14,232–$71,162 per violation
- **Tier 4 (Willful neglect, not corrected):** $71,162–$2,134,831 per violation

A "violation" can be each individual record exposed. Large breaches have resulted in fines exceeding $10 million.

## Getting Compliant: Where to Start

1. **Conduct a Risk Analysis** — This is the foundation; without it, nothing else is valid
2. **Inventory your ePHI** — Know what you have and where it is
3. **Implement MFA everywhere** — Non-negotiable under 2025 rules
4. **Audit your BAAs** — Identify every vendor with ePHI access; get signed agreements where missing
5. **Document your policies and procedures** — HIPAA is as much about documentation as technology
6. **Train your workforce** — Annual training with tracked completion for all staff with ePHI access

HIPAA compliance is not optional and the 2025 updates have raised the bar significantly. The good news: a structured approach makes compliance manageable, and the security improvements required also protect your organization from the breaches that trigger enforcement in the first place.
